Due to increasing number of Cloud services and the emergence and proliferation of semantic web, it has become essential for users to have access to  a search engine that can find the cloud services suitable to their needs .
This  fits our year-end project perfectly since the main objective is to develop a search algorithm for Clouds of services which is based on the concept of similarity .
The ontology of cloud resting on a set of interrelated concepts and in order to optimize the calculation result of similarity  cloud services  search results , we agreed on implementing three types of similarities : Similarity concepts, similarity of the object property and the similarity of the data type property.
And the purpose is to achieve and extensive , accurate and suitable search  for cloud services .
